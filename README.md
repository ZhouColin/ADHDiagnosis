# ADHDiagnosis

Some cautionary notes:
- Instead of PErsonal meeting bundle identifiers, we should set up a team one to avoid conflict with Firebase configurations

TODO:
- Need to figure out if ARKit2 is different frmo ARKit1 in that they dont' rely too heavily on eyelids and if it's more accurate (currently, ARKit1 is a bit jank in terms of accuracy)
- set up firebase and ARKit 
- Web scraping GCP Virtual instance for university health resources online
- looking into googlemaps API and setting up nearby health centers for ADHD 
- Implement our distance tracking algorithm for eye movement tracking
