Some cautionary notes:
- Instead of Personal meeting bundle identifiers, we should set up a team one to avoid conflict with Firebase configurations

TODO:
- Research ARKit on how it works to check if we can integrate w pygaze
- maybe even check if we can improve ARKit
- Work around Pygaze, see if viable option for our eye tracker
